### Notebooks

#### Buurman 2010 Frequency Index Analysis

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jwellik/csav_seismology/blob/main/dev/buurman_2010_frequency_index.ipynb)

This notebook computes and visualizes Frequency Index (FI) values from seismic catalogs and waveforms, following the methodology of Buurman and West (2010).

**Quick Start:**
1. Click the "Open in Colab" badge above to launch the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run the setup cells to configure the environment
3. Upload your catalog file or pre-computed data
4. Configure parameters and run the analysis

**Two workflows available:**
- **Option A**: Compute FI from catalog + datasource (automatically downloads waveforms)
- **Option B**: Load pre-computed data (use your own FI values, magnitudes, and waveforms)
